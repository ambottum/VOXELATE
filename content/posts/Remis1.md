### Introduction
In this string of blogs, I will write about the four-legged (two dog, two human) adventure that my dog and I began on in January of 2016. Caring for a paralyzed dog seems to be a nebulous topic for even most vet/medical circles I have found myself bringing questions to, so here I will try to offer as much advice (found only through trial and error) as possible to anyone who may be finding themselves in a similar situation.

##### Note: I do not claim any medical expertise. I wish only to provide an outline of my experiences so that they may help others in a similar situation.  

In this first post, you can read about the chronology of Remis' (pronounced like Remi) injury, in addition to a few symptoms of spinal cord injury/damage. *NOTE:* The first part of this story is not a happy one, but I'd like to make clear that while every situation will be slightly different, living with & taking care of a paralyzed dog is absolutely possible with three absolutely **vital** factors: love, patience, and commitment.


### January 16, 2016
Remis and Ruby, both 5 years old at the time, were (actually, both still are) incredibly athletic. Every day, every chance they'd get, they would be outside playing, chasing each other around the 5-acre yard. Remis was especially graceful; she could spin 180 degrees with a single step to evade a pounce from her counterpart, her bounding strides spraying seamless arcs of snow into the sun. On this day, Remis came in from playing in the snow & was behaving oddly.

##### **She was quieter than normal, and upon laying down, her eyes would slowly close and she would lean & tip her head back as though very slowly losing her balance. Just before it seemed she would fall backward, her eyes would snap open & she would lean forward again, only to repeat the process.**

Knowing that they were active dogs and hoping that perhaps Remis was just tired (honestly, she looked sort of like a student trying not to fall asleep in class), we resolved to keep her quiet for a few days. By the next day, she was even more **subdued**, & when she walked around the house, her strides looked oddly lackadaisical. She would still get excited to go outside, & run to play if we didn't stop her, **but the one thing she no longer had interest in was jumping up or down.**

By one and a half days after the initial odd behavior, I decided it was time to check in with a vet. We brought her in & relayed all of her symptoms. The vet seemed oddly unworried. The following was the one important & simple test she performed on Remis:

##### **The vet grabbed one of Remis' back paws, lifted it, curled it, & placed her curled toes on the floor, rather than her paw pad. What she was looking for was for Remis to quickly readjust her foot so that she would be standing on her paw pad rather than resting on curled toes. Unfortunately, Remis' feet only readjusted themselves after her body weight caused her to slip on her toes; very little automatic correction occured.**

Upon this behavior, the vet diagnosed Remis with 'some form' of spinal cord injury. Because all other functions appeared present, she said it was likely only a slight compression of the spinal cord that would be alleviated after a few days of rest. She instructed us to keep Remis quiet for a few days & assured us she'd be back to her normal self in a few days.

I returned home unassured, but with zero experience in the matter, I heeded her instructions. It wasn't enough. By the next day, Remis' hind end would crumple to the side when she tried to turn a corner. Two days later, she had become incontinent and lost function of her hind legs. Unfortunately, covering the cost of any sort of medical imaging of her spine was completely out of the question, and we were left to decide blindly how to move forward.

We decided upon the most aggressive treatment path that we could afford, meaning no imaging and no surgery, at this point still hoping she could return to normal functions. This meant two things:
<ul>
  <li>
  **Hoping for the best:**
  In order for Remis to get better without surgery, this had to be a situation where the spinal cord & vertebrae would be able to return to somewhat normal (no vertebrae pressing into spinal cord) positions without surgical interference. The most typical condition that would adhere to these requirements is a [slipped or herniated disk](https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/neurological/c_dg_intervertebral_disc_disease).
  </li>
  <li>
  **Treating for the worst:**
  If Remis' back were ever to return to 'normal', we had to *completely* eliminate movement so that further damage could not be done by continued movement of parts that should not be moving in the first place. This involves crate rest, *carrying* the dog to and from going to the bathroom (even if hind legs still function), and often a cocktail of pain killers and anti-inflammatory medication. Most commonly called [conservative treatment](http://www.dodgerslist.com/literature/healingpage.htm), this method is recommended for dogs who exhibit mild symptoms of nerve damage, so again, while we were working and hoping for Remis' full recovery, expenses and her severe symptoms were working against us.
  </li>
</ul>

Considering this, our initial treatment plan was as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    Aggressive crate rest: This includes no play time or walks, only being carried out to go to the bathroom. This was the hardest part, especially as Remis is a social dog & wanted to play & snuggle. Even though it's hard, being strict is for the best. We built a makeshift crate just big enough for Remis & her food & water bowls to restrict movement as much as possible, & put it in the busiest part of the house so she could still be with everyone. Even at night, Remis had to sleep in the crate, no sleeping with Rubi or on someone's bed, as this could cause unwanted movement.
    </li>
    <li>
    </li>
  </ul>  

In my next post, I will go into various methods of physical therapy (especially ones that can be done at home) that are most often prescribed to dogs suffering from a herniated disc. The last thing I'd like to mention here is the psychological aspect, for both dog and human, involved in this type of situation. Above I said the three most important factors in caring for a either a fully paralyzed dog or one on the road to recovery are love, patience, and commitment. That may just sound like the end of a bedtime story, but I will outline why I think these are so important.

<ul>
  <li>
  **Your dog will likely lose a lot of his natural confidence**
  An experience like this is painful & scary. Your dog's inherent capability to move himself away from intimidating situations is eliminated. For Remis, this meant her confidence in any task, even drinking water, completely disappeared. This is where giving love has helped incredibly. You can rebuild your dog's confidence by showing him encouraging affection, especially while he is considering an intimidating task, or right after he's completed it. Note here, every dog, human, and therefore relationship is different. Keep in mind natural body language for affection is different for dogs than for humans, so it is important to adjust your behavior accordingly. In addition, every dog is different. For Remis, the more love, the better she feels. I can imagine this may be suffocating for other dogs, so feel out what works best for your dog.

  </li>

  <li>
  **This is a big lifestyle change for both**
  Even the simplest tasks, like taking your dog outside to go to the bathroom, will take a few extra minutes. Be patient with both yourself and your dog as you transition into this sans-2 legs lifestyle. When your dog picks up on frustration, this will lead again to lower confidence.
  </li>

  <li>
  **Every day is a commitment**
  Especially in the beginning, there will be mistakes, accidents, trials & errors. If you decide to embark on this journey with your dog, stay true to your commitment to him & his health. When 10pm rolls around & he needs to go out, forget your long day & prepare your arms for the last haul of the day (you will get fit with the amount of lifting required :) ) For me, the relationship that has grown between Remis & I is completely worth the 1-2 extra hours per day of care she needs. Just as I have learned how to read into her every expression, she has done the same with me, & often is more in tune with my emotions & comforting me than even I myself.
