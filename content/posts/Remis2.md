### Introduction
In the last post, I talked about Remis’ initial stages of her two-legged adventure including what we know about the cause & then the more mental aspects of preparing for the challenges ahead - again I promise, from my perspective, it is completely worth it.

Here I will go into some of the physical therapy treatments we experimented with. It is important to note here, I was not in an ideal financial position for Remis’ treatment- so this post will be geared towards home and affordable rehabilitation options. Had I had the funds:
<ul>
  <li>
  Surgery would have been an option (according to many vets, surgical intervention within the first 24 hours can potentially turn around your dog’s prognosis)
  </li>
  <li>
  I could have brought Remis to a rehabilitation clinic. In our area alone there were two clinics that offered comprehensive rehabilitation programs for dogs in just her condition, with a price tag on the order of a few 1000’s of dollars.
  </li>
 </ul> 
To my complete dismay & personal disappointment, I couldn’t even dream of sending Remis to one day of such treatment. Determined to do everything in my power to help her recover, I called up these clinics, explained our situation, & they kindly worked with me to outline a rehab program I could accomplish at home. Note - please be sure to talk with your vet before beginning any therapy. How soon to start & which exercises you should do depend greatly on your dog’s situation. For someone like Remis, with a slipped disk, it is important to wait the duration of your dog’s crate rest period, as movement during this time can be very detrimental.  Below are the exercises that Remis & I did every day. There are many more exercises out there, these are just the ones that Remis was able to handle. 

#### Red Light Treatment
One of the first things suggested was red light treatment. Red light equipment can be rather pricey, so three times per week we visited the clinic for a 30-minute red light session. In the end, my dad built a home version for us so we were fortunate to be able to continue at home. Red light therapy has been shown to reduce inflammation and increase ATP production, two very important elements for a recovering injury. A scientific explanation can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4291815/), and a quick read on the topic [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4291815/).

#### Light Massage
Since Remis was on strict ‘crate’ rest, circulation to her hind legs was significantly  hindered. With lack of use, muscle atrophy is a concern as not only do muscles aide in movement, they help support the structural integrity of joints. While it can’t replace physical exercise, massage and muscle stimulation has a positive effect on these issues. Three times per day, at roughly 15 minutes each leg, I’d massage Remis’ muscles, working both towards her toes and away from them, making sure to spend equal time in each direction. I would massage -gently- from her shoulders all the way to her individual toes, including her tail. I think perhaps because massages feel good, this exercise in particular is where our relationship began to strengthen, and Remis really started to reemerge from the shell she’d retracted into post injury. Some points on the [benefits of massage](https://lessonsfromaparalyzeddog.com/7-benefits-dog-massage/).

#### Range of Motion
After massaging, I would simulate running/walking movements with Remis’ legs, both forward & backward. Here it is important to be extremely careful; your dog likely won’t be able to tell you if something is moving in a way it shouldn’t. In addition, with lack of exercise, his legs will be tighter than usual & as this exercise is meant to combat that tightness, it’s best to take it slow & if possible have your vet demonstrate a healthy range of motion for your dog. 

#### Joint Pressure 
After massaging & really getting the blood flowing, I would take her two back paws together, & while she was both on her side & her back (for this you’ll need someone to hold your dog steady), push her paws towards her, closing her leg angles until either I couldn’t go anymore, or I felt her push against me (this didn’t occur for a few weeks). I would do this about ten times. 

#### Reverse Squats
This exercise involves rebuilding the conscious efforts of your dog to use his legs. A [hip sling](https://lessonsfromaparalyzeddog.com/favorite-harnesses-handicapped-dogs/) will be useful here. If you do not have have one, fear not; I easily fashioned a hip sling by cutting leg & tail holes into a towel. If your dog is food oriented, that will work in your favor for this exercise. Situate your dog on a grippy surface (grass or a rubber mat work best) in a sitting position with both legs crouched straight, feet flat on the floor, as though he’s just about to stand up. Have one person stand a few feet in front of your dog. When the other person holds up a treat (or favorite toy), watch for your dog to use his legs to try to move forward. Initially, he may not ‘call’ to his legs at all - or atleast it may not look like it. Especially in the beginning, your dog’s muscles may barely twitch as he attempts to move - but the fact that there is the tiniest bit of movement is incredibly important- this means there’s a conscious connection between his mind and his legs. As soon as you detect any hints of him trying, help him the rest of the way up with the sling to get the treat (at first the treat may need to come to him rather than the other way around). More important than getting himself all the way to the treat is that your dog tries to move himself forward- that a conscious effort to move his legs- and that you help him accomplish his goal, so that he knows that if he calls on his legs for action, there will be a response from them. This exercise is more about strengthening mental muscles than physical ones. Since this exercise brushes on the subject of learned nonuse, for the next blog post I will put together some research on this tough mental phenomenon. 


While we were not able to do regular acupunture treatment, this alternative medicine has  shown to be very effective in dogs with paralysis. Below are a few resources to read up on acupuncture, both in dogs and general practice.
