      <strong>vox · el </strong> <br> noun   <i>(in computer-based modeling or graphic simulation) each of an array of elements of volume that constitute a notional three-dimensional space, especially each of an array of discrete elements into which a representation of a three-dimensional object is divided.</i> <br>

      At some point, on the top of some mountain, or maybe even sitting behind some towering, intimidating stack of homework, I realized the purpose of my life was to live it to the fullest- to experience & appreciate every last tiny pixel of it. This may sound like a completely egotistical purpose, but I think every truly altruistic act must be lit by intrinsic fire. <br>
      <br>
      The two things that make me feel fullest in life are seeing others bright with life & learning a new tool for living greater from someone else, then realizing its potential in my own life. Helping inspire others & being inspired myself are the most important factors, for me, in living with purpose. <br>

      Whenever I feel myself rolling too quick down the hill of time, speeding past the details & failing to feel their weight, pixelate is the word I put into my head- to remind me to slow down & break existence down to its smallest units, its pixels, & turn each of them over in my head- appreciate them, learn from them- the feel of the music, the color of the world, the weight of someone’s words, the crispness of a decision. Then I learned that a voxel is a three-dimensional pixel- sort of like a pixel but with more information, more weight inside it than meets the eye. Ever since, voxelate has been my word. <br>

      This may not be what works for you, or maybe for anyone else, but if there is one thought I hope to leave you with, it is this: find what makes you full - full to the brim with life. It’s here, in this space between the height of presentness and feeling the weight of your own existence that we can really become positive members of the world around us. This has implications everywhere, from bringing a smile to the face of a stranger in need to creating a supportive community all the way to building sustainable future for ourselves & for our planet. <br>
