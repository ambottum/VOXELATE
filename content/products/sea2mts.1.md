There's something about thin air that clears the mind. Closer to the edge of the sky, the everyday struggles of life down below slide away, down the slopes you just climbed, & all that is left is your mind & the vast expanse of life that resides within your gaze. From the tiniest flower to the tallest mountaintop, the undeniable beauty opens your mind beyond the furthest peaks and centers it exactly here.
